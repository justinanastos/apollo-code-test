# Apollo Code Test

_Justin Anastos_

## Setup

1. Install npm dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    or if you're using yarn:

    ```
    yarn
    ```

2. Run it!

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    This will run the `index` file, which is a thin wrapper around `main` (for no other reason than I put it together before the test not knowing what the test would be like).

## Watch Mode

```shell
npm run watch
```

## Test

```shell
npm test
```

## Open Chrome Devtools

```shell
npm run debug
```
